## Submission for Impact.com

A Java Maven project that implements the `NumberRangeSummarizer` interface.  
It collects a comma-delimited list of numbers, removes duplicates and invalid inputs, and summarizes sequential numbers into ranges.

## Example

**Input:**
"1,3,6,7,8,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,24,31"

**Output:**
"1, 3, 6-8, 12-15, 21-24, 31"

## Assumptions
- Duplicate values are removed.
- Input may contain invalid (non-integer) values â†’ these are ignored.
- Input may be unsorted.
- Negative numbers are supported.
- Empty or null input returns an empty collection or empty string.
